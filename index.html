            <p style="color: pink;text-align: center;font-size: 22px;">I play Factorio and think of you.<br>
I wire the circuits you never learned to trace,<br>
Power lines sparking through the silence you left.<br>
You said I couldn't, but now I optimize,<br>
Steel flows like stubborn rivers, engines turning where<br>
 your gears froze.
Train bridges, chain signals, logistics aligned,<br>
Bots tracing patterns you never designed.<br>
I built a world from ruins you left behind,<br>
While you only knew how to destroy and unwind.<br>
I watched the biters come in relentless waves,<br>
Till I learned to tame the pollution they crave.<br>
Kept the map clean, the air quiet, controlled the spread,<br>
So theyâ€¢d leave me alone, silent and unfed.<br>
I automated grief, turned sorrow to yield,<br>
Pain into power, silence revealed.<br>
You called me broken, said I'd never survive.<br>
But I built a self that rises every time.<br>
Now satellites circle the sky I command,<br>
My world runs on modules, solar arrays grand.<br>
I don't need your blueprints, I made my own base.<br>
A megabase of strength built in my space.<br>
But the truth is I want you still,<br>
I think of you quietly - against my will.</p>
